    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favourite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>Other than writing software, I like to draw in my free time.</p>
    <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
    <p>I learnt a lot about back-end software development during my years at the Technion, but these were always ugly and not eye pleasing. I'd like to build the front end as well to be able to wrtie a full software solution myself.</p>
